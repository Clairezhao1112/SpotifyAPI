# After: Enriched, AI-Assisted Event Insights

The enriched pipeline adds interpretable signals and human-readable context on top of the original data. Using light scraping plus the DeepSeek API, each event now includes a ticket price range (minimum and maximum), a time-to-event field, a composite hype score that blends Spotify artist popularity with price spread and days until the event, and a simple traffic-light sellout risk indicator. DeepSeek also generates a short description for each event so readers can skim highlights without opening external pages. The result is a concise, insight-rich view that surfaces demand, urgency, and momentum at a glance, turning raw listings into actionable summaries suitable for quick scanning and downstream decision-making.
