# Before: Raw Event & Music Data

This project initially assembled raw information by querying the Spotify API for artist-related data and scraping Ticketmaster for event details. From Spotify, the dataset included albums, track names, publication dates, public links, and artist popularity scores. From Ticketmaster, it captured basic event fields such as venue, city, date/time, and a purchase URL when present. While this provided a solid foundation, the data required users to manually infer demand, urgency, and overall interest. There were no derived signals for ticket price ranges, risk of sellout, or concise summaries, which made quick comparisons and prioritization difficult.
