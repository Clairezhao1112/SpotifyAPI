“These are the keys I received to access the Spotify API. I want to allow users to input the artist name and retrieve the albums, song names, and date of publication.”  After this was given to ChatGPT multiple times, the output for artists with many albums (such as Taylor Swift) was extremely long. By looking closely at the code, I realized that the code includes the retrieval of the artist ID, song ID, and track ID, which I believe are unnecessary components of the code, and users using this wouldn’t need to know them.  Instead, I modified the code to remove these identifiers and added functionality to retrieve the popularity and Spotify URL for each song, which are more relevant for end users.

Next, I tried a similar approach with Ticketmaster. Initially, I attempted to scrape their website, but the AI-generated code expected me to have an API key, which Ticketmaster would not provide for free. I prompted AI again with the page source and clarified that I am scraping Ticketmaster and not using its API. API. A recurring bug I found was that the code did not properly use the user’s artist name input, and in many runs the events were either not printed or not found in the output. I manually fixed these issues by ensuring the scraper correctly accepted 

I prompt Cluade.AI to condense the code to about 150 lines. By doing this, AI helped me remove all helper functions and integrated them into 3 helpful main functions, remove extensive error handling, and condensed JSON parsing. The performance of this code was surprisingly the same as the original output, but I think the runtime might have been longer and lack of really detailed error handling.
